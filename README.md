Telling Stories With Data, Xingyue Jiang's Portfolio Page 

# About Me
Hello! I am Xingyue Jiang, a second-year student from MSPPM program. Friends call me Ruby. I have worked in several non-profit organizations and hope to be a policy analyst after graduation.

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn to create a portfolio that can be used in job applications. It's my first time to learn Github and Tableau, too.

# Portfolio
Here is all of my cool data visualizaton will go!

# Assignment 2: Government Debt Rati

# Third Data Visualization-Scatterplot with an Average

My understanding of the dataset is to show the Debt-GDP ratio of different OECD countries over the years. Three visualizations have different focuses.

The first bar chart gives a comparison between countries in a fixed year. The first visualization is simple but straightforward. The country's ratio goes up from left to right. The audience can get a basic idea of which country has the highest/lowest ratio in 2018, and the ratio range by percentage. The second visualization shows the trendline of the debt-to-GDP ratio by countries. It's hard to compare different countries' ratio levels, but the audience gets a general idea of how each country's financial performance is from 1996 to 2019. The third visualization is a scatterplot. Using the scatter plot, I wish to compare different countries' ratio all together in a more precise way. The above-average line makes it easier to tell if the country's performance is satisfying. Also, I use the blue color series to represent years, which is convenient to track the ratio changes from 1996 to 2019.

This graph is from the Pew Center’s 2018 American Social Trend Dataset. It’s also a part of the report, “Women and Leadership 2018.” The report claims that although Americans say they would like to see more women in top leadership positions, men still have an easier path both in political offices and large business companies. Female/Male and Republicans/Democrats also have widely different attitude towards the female leadership. I chose the graph because it has a very clear message: to show the comparison between F/M and Rep/Dem. Also, it includes two sub groups at one time. The report argues that the F/M gaps persist within parties. How to revise the basic bar chart with two related comparisons will be the focus of my assignment.

# Feedback and Reflection
I selected two friends that major in liberal arts. I suppose if a reader without a statistics background can easily understand the visualization, the message will be better conveyed to the general public. Friend 1 is male and Friend 2 is female. 

Friend#1
  - “Icons are eye catchy but not very necessary. And I don’t quite get what they are at first.”
  - “It’s confusing that the rep and female use very similar colors.”
  - “I get it that ‘fewer women’ and ‘there is gender discrimination’ are two different things. But It seems a little bit redundant. Especially when the two phrases are highlighted.”

Friend #2
  - “Too many little graphs. Is it possible to combine them altogether?”
  - “Icons are weird. I don’t think business and political leaders’ difference is a focus of the visualization.”
  - “Can’t get the message at first sight. Need to look back and forth. ”
  - “The percentage figures need a better format.”

My reflection:
  - Get rid of icons: I didn’t expect that my audience don’t like the icons. I thought they are fun and clear, it’s my bad painting’s fault. But my friend is right, they are too eye catchy. Even people can tell that which is business/politics, it doesn’t help to understand the wide gap between different political parties and genders. The readers wasted time on a relatively unimportant category.
  - Small graphs may distract attention: I will try to experiment with other graph type rather than simple bar chart groups.
  - Colors and text: The rep/dem group remains red and blue. I go with the original color choice of Pew Center to use yellow and green, 
  - Keep the “fewer group”. I will keep the "fewer" attitude group. The raw data of "gender discrimination" doesn't suggest a wide gap (as discussed in critique), and readers get similar messages from "fewer group" and "gender discrimination".
