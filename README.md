# About Me
Hello! I am Xingyue Jiang, a second-year student from MSPPM program. Friends call me Ruby. I have worked in several non-profit organizations and hope to be a policy analyst after graduation.

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn to create a portfolio that can be used in job applications. It's my first time to learn Github and Tableau, too.

Here is all of my cool data visualizaton will go!

My understanding of the dataset is to show the Debt-GDP ratio of different OECD countries over the years. Three visualizations have different focuses.

The first bar chart gives a comparison between countries in a fixed year. The first visualization is simple but straightforward. The country's ratio goes up from left to right. The audience can get a basic idea of which country has the highest/lowest ratio in 2018, and the ratio range by percentage. The second visualization shows the trendline of the debt-to-GDP ratio by countries. It's hard to compare different countries' ratio levels, but the audience gets a general idea of how each country's financial performance is from 1996 to 2019. The third visualization is a scatterplot. Using the scatter plot, I wish to compare different countries' ratio all together in a more precise way. The above-average line makes it easier to tell if the country's performance is satisfying. Also, I use the blue color series to represent years, which is convenient to track the ratio changes from 1996 to 2019.
