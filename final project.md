Changes Made:
- Change the "Who is not wearing mask" part. Change circles into icons. Change colors to be consistent with the presentation's color code.
- Change the color and font of the data story's text. Use blue background. Highlight information with red colors.
- Change the "top reasons for not wearing masks" part. Change the pie chart for word cloud. When using pie chart, the text are too small and too long to read. Word cloud can demonstrate the reasons in a more straightforward way.
- References are added and revised by standard.
- Change the mortality line chart to a racing line chart. Add new groups to the dataset. By using racing line chart, the audience can observe the changes in mortality over time.
- Get rid of the "nudge" theory. Replace it with "information provison". It' easier to understand.
- Add two new charts to "information provision". The orginal draft of information provision is only text. From the charts, we can see although U.S. citizens are concerned about the information update, they don't think they are well-informed by government and experts. This could be a transition for the call-to-action-part.
- Delete the forcasting model chart. The forecasting is outdated. Also, the first part should be brief. 
- Add a call-to-action page. Add CMU info page and CDC guidance page as th final call to action.
- Change some photos of information provision. Replace the photo of social distancing with a photo of mask distribution machine.
