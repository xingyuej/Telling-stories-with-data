# Final Project
# Part 1
# Summary
- The project will discuss the mask wearing in the year of 2020 under the covid pandemic. 
- Story Arc: 

① Mask helps! 

The presentation will start with the facial mask's benefits, especially for preventing the spread of COVID-19. A: Scientifc figures on how facial mask work. B: Predictions that deaths prevented by wearing masks in U.S. C: Comparison of case number and death rate between area where people tend to wear facial mask/ not wear facial mask. 
             
 ② Who are using masks? 
 
 U.S is not performing well compared to other countries in persuading people wearing facial masks. We need to further discuss which group of people refuse to wear masks and the reasons. A: Gender/Partisan/Ethnic gap in wearing masks. B: Mask usage by U.S. county/around the world. C.U.S. citizens' attitude towards facial masks. 

③ We still need more people wear masks to overcome the pandemic (call to action).

A: The mask usage change since the covid. B. Policies changes regarding encouraging people to wear masks and provide free masks. Mask usage is increasing since the outbreak of pandemic, but people should continue: 1. Tell friends and families to wear masks. Do people know how tow wear masks properly? 2. More free masks for the needed people. Also, this part could include how to pick a right facial mask. A comparison of different materials for masks can be added at the end if time is permitted.

- How to use the data: Most data are in the format of csv. Some data need to be input manually.

Benefits of Masks: Prediction of death rate if masks are weared by 95% of people. Comparison of death rate by countries combined with comparison of mask usage by countries. Experiment figures of facial masks and high speed droplets.

Mask Usage and Attitudes: People with higher education level/ higher income tend to wear mask. Narrow down the groups of people who refuse to wear masks. The top reasons of people don't believe in masks. 

Call to action, Masks on: Sentiment analysis of policy regarding masks. Free masks provision by percentage. Assessment of different fabrics for a standard mask. 


# Method
- Step 1: Reorganizing the datasets. The raw dataset will be in csv. and docx. The final format will include parts of the data in a 
- Step 2: Wireframe. Complete the wireframe with the assitance of Balsamiq. Follow the step of assignment 3&4 to ask for friends' advice and revise. Some data-viz will be revised from existing data-viz. The number of data-viz revised from existing reports will not exceed two. 
- Step 3: Final Data-viz. The data visualization will be created by Tableau and Flourish. 
- Step 4: The final presentation will be created by shorthand, combining graphs and analysis.

# User Research 
# Target audience
- The targeted audience is the general public in United States, especially those who have doubts in wearing facial masks. A variety in gender and education level is preferred.
- #1: U.S. citizen. CMU student. Female.
- #2: U.S. citizen. Doorman of my apartment. Male.
- #3: U.S. citizen. Faculty of CMU. Female. Statistic Major.
# Goals and Quesetions
- Data-Viz: Are the graphs clear and easy to understand. Where to change?
- Emotional Appeal: How do you feel about wearing masks after the presentation? Will you wear masks more often?
- Data accuracy: Is there anything misleading or confusing?
- Improvement: What related information you feel it's necessary but not include in the presentation.

# User Feedback
- #1: The date of some graphs are confusing. For example, the forecasting model is for October 2020. It's outdated.
- #2: The call to action is unclear. Try to explain behavioral economy terms with some simple exmaples.
- #3: Font style and background images needs to be more consistent. Use more highlighted text to better deliver the message.
- #4: Establish the connection between the reason of not usin mask and solution.
- #5: May need a more eye-catching beginning. Consider getting rid of some of the scientific explainations at the start.
