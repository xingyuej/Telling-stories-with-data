My understanding of the dataset is to show the Debt-GDP ratio of different OECD countries over the years. Three visualizations have different focuses.

The first bar chart gives a comparison between countries in a fixed year. The first visualization is simple but straightforward. The country's ratio goes up from left to right. The audience can get a basic idea of which country has the highest/lowest ratio in 2018, and the ratio range by percentage. The second visualization shows the trendline of the debt-to-GDP ratio by countries. It's hard to compare different countries' ratio levels, but the audience gets a general idea of how each country's financial performance is from 1996 to 2019. The third visualization is a scatterplot. Using the scatter plot, I wish to compare different countries' ratio all together in a more precise way. The above-average line makes it easier to tell if the country's performance is satisfying. Also, I use the blue color series to represent years, which is convenient to track the ratio changes from 1996 to 2019.
